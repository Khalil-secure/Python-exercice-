# Python-exercice-
its an exercice on implimenting dijkstra in python , its graphe and we need to search for the best way to get to place B from A while getting to acumulate the smallest nomber of value
ths project is made throug my schooling years of igenieuring i learned a new programme in school, and i wanted to share whith this community and make myself a name hoho sorry not mature enouh defietly i l cringe when i ll read this in the future
this programme is for graphes that has values onits roads that connects alot of heads ,we re usig matrics to represent the graphe so its not applicable for a big graphe as it has so mush limitation in the application process.
we use matrics whith every road between head and its values , while we choose one head to make the roads from then camparing its values whit it witche then we use another mattricx that we change consance through a reccurence fonction till the finale form
that represent the smalles number accumulated through proceeding through roads connecting the head start and as the end of  any other head
